# 🌱 AgriSight: AI-Powered Crop Health Assistant

AgriSight is an **AI-powered, offline-friendly mobile application** that helps farmers detect plant diseases using just a smartphone camera. Unlike existing apps (like Plantix), AgriSight is built for **rural India**, focusing on **offline access, multilingual support, eco-friendly recommendations, and farmer data privacy**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📸 **AI Crop Disease Detection** – Detects common plant diseases from a leaf image.  
- 🌐 **Offline-First** – Works without internet; syncs only when online.  
- 🗣️ **Multilingual + Voice Assistant** – Supports English, Hindi, and regional languages with text-to-speech for illiterate farmers.  
- 🌱 **Eco-Friendly Solutions** – Suggests natural, low-cost treatments (e.g., neem spray) instead of chemical-heavy pesticides.  
- 🔒 **Farmer Data Privacy** – Data stays on the farmer’s device, uploaded only with consent.  
- 📊 **Future Expansion** – Yield prediction, weather alerts, and market price integration.

## 🎯 Why AgriSight Stands Out
Most existing apps like Plantix require constant internet and focus heavily on chemical solutions.  
**AgriSight is different because:**
- Works in **low-connectivity areas** (offline-first).  
- Prioritizes **organic and sustainable practices**.  
- Adds **voice and multilingual support** to include every farmer.  
- Gives farmers **control of their own data**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter (cross-platform mobile app)  
- **Backend (optional):** Firebase / Node.js for syncing  
- **AI Model:** TensorFlow Lite (on-device inference)  
- **Database:** SQLite (local offline storage)

## 📱 Screens (Prototype)
1. **Home Screen** – Upload plant image.  
2. **Results Screen** – Shows detected disease + suggested treatment.  
3. **Language Switcher** – Toggle English/Hindi/others.

## 🏆 Inspiration
India loses **20–40% of crops annually** due to diseases and lack of access to timely solutions. AgriSight aims to **empower farmers** with AI-driven, privacy-friendly, offline tools that bridge this gap.
